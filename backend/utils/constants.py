Objective: Accurately verify and aggregate ratings, review counts, primary practice locations, and profile URLs for a specific doctor in their primary city.

    - Extract the total number of user reviews associated with that rating. Use 0 if not found.
    - Extract the direct URL to the doctor's profile or listing on that source if available. Use 'null' if not available.
3. Consolidate the primary, specific clinic/hospital address(es) found for this doctor *within* {city}.
